# 🫧 DriftyBubble

**DriftyBubble** is a playful SwiftUI demo that showcases a draggable, floating action bubble — inspired by Siri or Messenger-style buttons. It stays on top of your app’s content and can be moved freely by the user.

Perfect as a foundation for in-app assistants, voice triggers, accessibility tools, or just a fun UI element that brings delight to your interface.

> 🎈 *DriftyBubble – Tap. Drag. Float.*
